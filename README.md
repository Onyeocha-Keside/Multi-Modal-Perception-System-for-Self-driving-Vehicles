# Multi-Modal Perception System for Self-Driving Vehicles

## Project Overview

This repository contains a TensorFlow implementation of a multi-modal perception system designed for self-driving vehicles. The system uses deep learning techniques to fuse data from multiple sensors (cameras, LiDAR, and radar) to detect and classify objects in the vehicle's environment.

### Key Features

- Multi-modal sensor fusion (camera, LiDAR, radar)
- End-to-end learning from raw sensor data to object detection and classification
- Efficient architecture suitable for real-time processing
- Flexible design allowing for easy extension to additional sensor types or outputs

## Code Structure

- SensorFusionNet: A TensorFlow Keras model that processes and fuses data from multiple sensors.
- MultiModalDataGenerator: A custom data generator for efficient batch processing of multi-modal input data.
- train_model: A function that defines the training loop, including loss calculation, optimization, and validation.

## Requirements

- TensorFlow 2.x
- NumPy

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/self-driving-perception.git
   

2. Install the required dependencies:
   bash
   pip install tensorflow numpy
   

3. Run the main script:
   bash
   python main.py
   

*Note:* The current implementation uses placeholder random data. To use real data, you'll need to modify the data loading and preprocessing steps in the main() function.

## Future Development Plans

1. *Data Collection and Preprocessing:*
   - Implement data loading and preprocessing for real sensor data (camera images, LiDAR point clouds, radar data)
   - Develop data augmentation techniques to improve model generalization

2. *Model Improvements:*
   - Experiment with different neural network architectures for each sensor type
   - Implement attention mechanisms for better sensor fusion
   - Explore more advanced object detection techniques (e.g., YOLO, SSD)

3. *Training and Evaluation:*
   - Implement a more robust training pipeline with checkpointing and early stopping
   - Add comprehensive evaluation metrics (mAP, IoU, etc.)
   - Develop a visualization tool for model predictions

4. *Real-world Integration:*
   - Integrate the perception system with other self-driving components (path planning, control)
   - Implement real-time processing optimizations
   - Develop a simulation environment for testing and validation

5. *Extended Functionality:*
   - Add support for temporal data (e.g., using RNNs or 3D convolutions)
   - Implement multi-task learning for additional outputs (e.g., road segmentation, depth estimation)
   - Explore unsupervised or self-supervised learning techniques for better feature extraction

6. *Deployment:*
   - Optimize the model for embedded systems (model quantization, pruning)
   - Develop a pipeline for continuous integration and deployment
